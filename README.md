# homiebot
A bot for a server with my friends 


## Updates
Added a locally hosted web dashboard, still working on specific features though. 

> For the commit on Jan 16th, 2021 on the counter.razor file, this message thing is just me getting the DiscordClient variable in the bot.cs file, then making a function which sends a message in the specified guild and channel.

## I have no idea why there are two different homiebot folders, it happened when I created the dockerfile and had to edit the folder name
